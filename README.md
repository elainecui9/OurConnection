DSGN 208 Design Thinking & Doing project to answer the question, how might we create a platform to allow incarcerated women's voices to be heard? 

Collaborated and prototyped with Women Initiating New Directions: https://windprogram.org/

This is a website that allows women to join a Pen Pal Program that connects previously incarcerated women, as well as other community members with varying relationships. Moreover, the platform allows incarcerated women to post their stories to be shared with the community. Our goal is to provide incarcerated women the opportunity to tell their stories, to have community and connection outside of their jail or prison, and the opportunity to learn about what life will be like for them after incarceration, which helps them prepare and build skills for their release.
